# Campaign Cart Starter Templates

Starter templates for building sales funnel pages — checkout, post-purchase upsells, and order confirmation — using the [Campaign Cart SDK](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/campaign-cart/) by NextCommerce.

## What's in this repo

| Folder | What it is |
|--------|------------|
| `campaign-kit-templates/` | Campaign-kit project with all 7 templates. **Start here.** |
| `static-templates/` | Raw static HTML source files. Reference only — do not modify. |

---

## Getting started

**Step 1 — Initialise your project** (if you haven't already)

```bash
npx campaign-init
```

This creates `_data/campaigns.json` and adds the `dev`, `build`, `clone`, and `config` npm scripts to your `package.json`.

**Step 2 — Copy a template and name it after your product**

Pick a template from the [available templates](#available-templates) table below. Copy its folder into your project and rename it to your product — this becomes the slug used in your URLs.

```bash
cp -r campaign-cart-starter-templates/campaign-kit-templates/src/demeter your-project/src/your-campaign-name
```

Your campaign will be served at `https://your-campaign-domain/your-campaign-name/checkout`.

**Step 3 — Add the campaign entry**

Open `campaign-cart-starter-templates/campaign-kit-templates/_data/campaigns.json`, find the entry matching the template you chose, and paste it into your project's `_data/campaigns.json`. Then update:

- `slug` — must match the folder name you used (e.g. `your-campaign-name`)
- `name` — human-readable campaign name
- `store_url`, `store_name`, and other store fields
- Leave `sdk_version` as-is unless you need a specific version

**Step 4 — Set your API key**

```bash
npm run config
```

This prompts you to enter your [Campaigns App API key](https://developers.nextcommerce.com/docs/campaigns/campaign-cart/) and writes it into `src/[slug]/assets/config.js`.

**Step 5 — Start developing**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Pick your campaign from the interactive prompt. The dev server will hot-reload as you edit.

> **To create a variant:** run `npm run clone` — it copies an existing campaign to a new slug and updates `campaigns.json` automatically.

## Available templates

| Slug | Funnel type | Pages |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `demeter` | Single-step checkout | checkout |
| `limos` | Single-step checkout | checkout |

All campaigns share an upsell page (up01 or up01-mv) and a receipt page.

---

## npm scripts

Run these inside `campaign-kit-templates/`:

```bash
npm run dev        # interactive campaign picker + dev server
npm run build      # build all campaigns to _site/
npm run clone      # duplicate a campaign with a new slug
npm run compress   # optimise images
npm run config     # set Campaigns App API keys
```

## AI development rules

Copy the relevant rules file into your project before using an AI assistant to build or modify templates. Most AI tools load a rules file automatically from your project root — check your tool's documentation for the exact filename and location (e.g. `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.cursor/rules/` for Cursor).

| Working with | Rules file |
|---|---|
| `campaign-kit-templates/` | [docs/campaign-cart-ai-rules.md](docs/campaign-cart-ai-rules.md) |
| `static-templates/` | [static-templates/campaign-cart-rules.md](static-templates/campaign-cart-rules.md) |
